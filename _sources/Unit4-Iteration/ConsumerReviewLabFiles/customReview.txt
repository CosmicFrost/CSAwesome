This year was my first time and I had a great time, and learned a lot. Have fun with your outfit (and hat), but wear comfortable shoes because most folks do a lot of walking and standing. Check the weather and bring jackets if needed. People are very friendly though some have a little too much to fun.

Uber/Lyft/taxi drop off locations could be a mile or more from Churchill Downs unless you go early before they close the roads. Parking and using the shuttle is very efficient and easy getting to the track, though there are very long lines to get back on the shuttle to reach your car.

Getting your bets in is easy though you will have to wait in line. Be considerate of others and make your picks before you get in line. The people around you are generally more than happy to help if you ask.
